    <h2>About Me: </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Jaclyn. I am a mathemtician and computer programmer.  In 2015 I graduated with my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics from the University at Albany. I have been tutoring all levels of math from elementary school to college in all topics since 2013. I always had a strong passion for Algebra. Due to this my advisor suggested to learn how to write code. In 2017 I decided to take a few Java courses at Hudson Valley Community College and loved it. I am  currently taking a front end web development class with Albany Can Code. My future goal is to become a software developer.</p>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>I am a very proud mommy of a three cats. Their names are Duchess, Gibby, and Princess. During my free time I foster kittens, volunteer at adoption events and go on rescues with a non-profit kitten and pregnant mom resue, Kitten Angels. I have been volunteering with them for the past 6 years. Another hobby of mine is learning self defense. I did Shotokon karate for 13 years, kick boxing for 2 years and boxing for 2 years. I believe every woman should know how to defend herself and encourage other women to learn.</p>
